# Vue.js component development guide

## Components

- The components should be self-contained, well-written using natural, idiomatic code. Everything needed for the component should be in one file: the component file. This file is the only thing that should be delivered.

## Styling

- Do not use inline CSS in templates. Use properly scoped SCSS in the style section of the file.
